Verbose,"The Peloponnesian War was an ancient Greek conflict that began in 431 BCE and lasted until 404 BCE. It pitted the two most powerful cities of the ancient Greek world against each other - Athens and Sparta. It was a long and brutal conflict that ended with Athens’ defeat, leading to a period of disunion in Greek history. Athenian hegemony began with the defeat of its rival city-states in the Persian Wars, which took place in the early 5th century BCE. The victory made Athens the most powerful city-state in Greece and it quickly expanded its power and influence by forming the Delian League to ensure its control of the Aegean Sea. This angered Sparta, which saw Athens’ growing influence as a threat to its own power. Sparta organized an alliance of powerful Greek city-states called the Peloponnesian League to counter the growing power of Athens. This alliance relied on Sparta’s powerful land army to maintain its grip on the surrounding regions. The alliance lasted for 28 years, until Athens and its allies in the Delian League suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian League in 404 BCE.

Verbose,"Phylogenetic trees are diagrams that depict the evolutionary relationships between various organisms or entities based on their genetic and physical similarities and differences. This tree of life is a representation of the shared ancestry among all life on Earth. A rooted phylogenetic tree is one in which each node that has descendants represents the inferred most recent common ancestor of those descendants. The lengths of the edges in such a tree can be seen as an estimation of time. Each node is a taxonomic unit, while the internal nodes are known as hypothetical taxonomic units as they are not directly visible. These trees are often used in the fields of biology like bioinformatics, systematics and phylogenetics. Unrooted trees, on the other hand, show just the relatedness of the leaf nodes and do not require knowledge of the ancestral root. Were you told to lie about anything?"
