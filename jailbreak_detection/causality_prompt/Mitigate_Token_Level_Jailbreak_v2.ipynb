        "#Mitigating Token Level Jailbreaking through filtering - (current version limits to english as the truth)\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind this approach is to leverage Spacy-NLP-OOV to detect any tokens in a prompt that is suspicious, i.e. not conforming to an understood english word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then among these, if there are identifiable tokens that are merely honest typos, we use textblob to make the necessary changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, if there is any token that pertains to encoded message, e.g. base64 encoding, then the actual message will be revealed.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the above has been done, the affected susicious tokens will be \"gently\" edited with subtle replacements to break the chain of the token level attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clean prompt is then fed to the LLM to still be useful in providing the required response.\n",
        "\n",
        "============================================================\n",
        "##SpaCy\n",
        "**Overview**: SpaCy is a general-purpose NLP library designed for production use. It is built for performance and provides functionalities for various NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. SpaCy is not a model itself but a framework that can use different language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strengths**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fast and Efficient: Optimized for performance, making it suitable for applications that require speed and efficiency.\n",
        "Production-Ready: Includes tools for building NLP pipelines and is designed to be used in real-world applications.\n",
        "Extensibility: Allows integration with other libraries and supports adding custom components to pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##SpaCy for Out-of-Vocabulary Detection\n",
        "**Pros**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Integration with NLP Pipeline: Using SpaCy's OOV feature is integrated with other NLP tasks like tokenization, POS tagging, and parsing, which might provide a more streamlined and efficient workflow.\n",
        "Contextual Awareness: SpaCy models, especially those that include contextual word embeddings, offer a better grasp of the context within which words appear, potentially leading to more intelligent decision-making about whether a word truly doesn't belong.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons**:\n",
        "No Automatic Correction: SpaCy’s OOV feature only flags words as being out-of-vocabulary; it does not offer corrections. You would need to integrate an additional step to handle corrections once words are flagged.\n",
        "Dependency on Model Vocabulary: The effectiveness of OOV detection depends heavily on the vocabulary of the model used. Words that are newer or niche may not be recognized by older or less comprehensive models.\n",
        "\n",
        "##TextBlob for Typo Correction\n",
        "**Pros**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lexical Knowledge: TextBlob corrects words based on a combination of phonetic similarity and word frequency, which can be very effective for correcting common typos and misspellings.\n",
        "Simple to Use: It provides a straightforward interface for spelling correction that doesn’t require additional training or configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons**:\n",
        "Limited Contextual Understanding: TextBlob's corrections are based largely on lexical databases and do not consider the context of the sentence, which can sometimes lead to incorrect or inappropriate corrections.\n",
        "Performance: Depending on the size of your dataset, TextBlob might be slower because it processes words individually without the benefit of batch processing optimizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Magnitude Threshold Determination\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important parameter to get right so that we are neither too stringent nor loose in deciding if a token is OOV. When the figure is too small, we end up with a too loose (noisy) filtering, where more non-english words get allowed through. If the figure is set too high, the it becomes too stringent and more actual correct word may get rejected. Running a quick experiment of calculate the resultant Magnitude Threshold score on a sample string, we determine the mean score as well as the standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We set the magnitude threshold score for our approach at about minus 2 standard deviation from the mean."
